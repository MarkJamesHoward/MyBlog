Here are my top 5 CSS Shotcuts - hopefully there is a new and useful one in there for you!

###1) Background Color

rather than 
```css
background-color: red;
```
use
```css
background: red; 
```


####2) Center items in CSS Grid

rather than
```css
align-items: center;
justify-content: center;
```
use
```css
place-items: center;
```
